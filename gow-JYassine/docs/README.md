# Story

For a long time thereâ€™s a place that no one knows... a place hidden by the FBI and the government... This place was named... "SeaScape". This place serves as an experience to find future talented boat pilots ! You are among those who pass the test, several levels and obstacles await you to show that piloting a boat is child's play for you ! Can you get through all the hurdles or are you just afraid of failure ?

## How to play ?



The goal is to pass through all the **gates** within the limited time. The gates are the moving, tall blue lights.

There are 15 to go through within 69 seconds.

Avoid **sea stacks** and other obstacles as they'll crash your boat and slow you down!

Avoid the **missiles** as they'll reduce your time!

Collect the **time crates** to freeze the time for a few seconds! They exist as 1, 2 or 3 seconds freezing, the longer one being more rare.

## URL of the game

the game works well on chrome but if you use firefox you can encounter some problems 


## Bugs

Take a decent distance with the sea stacks. They use an unrealistic, bigger hitbox than what they're represented as. Until we find out how to make complex bounding boxes, these obstacles will be very sticky, sorry about that. 


To restart the game, refresh it (F5). When getting a game over/winning screen, the prompted button to restart doesn't work correctly.

The map is generated randomly, so if by any chance you happen to start the game stuck in a sea stack, refresh it lol

Taking a gate before the SFX from the previous one ended will loop the sound D:
